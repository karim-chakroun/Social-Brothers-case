#### You can filter the addresses by :
- Typing the keyword in the filter field.
- Typing the attribute you wanna order by (country,street,id,houseNumber,zipCode,city or you can add a new attribute and name it) in the attribute field.
- Chosing the desc field as true or false( true means descending and false means ascending sort).

## Feedback

ðŸ˜„ I'm proud of the dynamic filter and sorting part. It was a great challenge for me, first I made a static filter. You can check it in the first commit but then I made it.

ðŸ¤” The code can be better. There is a bug if you try putting a filter without a sorting attribute you will have error 500. It needs to be fixed but I didn't have time to finish it but I think that I made it through the hard part.
